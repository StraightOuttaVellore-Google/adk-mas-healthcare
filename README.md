# ADK Wellness Bots

A comprehensive AI-powered wellness system built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) that provides specialized mental health support through two distinct agents: General Wellness and Study Stress Management.

## üåü Features

### General Wellness Agent
- **Emotional Analysis**: Identifies emotions, focus areas, and mental wellness patterns
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides tailored advice, wellness exercises, and resources
- **Safety-First Approach**: Built-in safety review and refinement system
- **Memory Integration**: Remembers previous conversations for continuity

### Study Stress Agent
- **Academic-Focused Analysis**: Specialized in student mental health and study-related challenges
- **Study Strategy Recommendations**: Time management, study techniques, and academic wellness
- **Task Prioritization**: Uses Eisenhower Priority Matrix for effective planning
- **Student-Specific Resources**: Targeted tools and techniques for academic success

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system uses a multi-agent architecture with:

- **Parallel Processing**: Summary and recommendation agents work simultaneously
- **Safety Refinement Loop**: Iterative safety review and improvement
- **Memory Management**: Persistent conversation memory using Mem0
- **Modular Design**: Separate agents for different wellness domains

## üìù Sample Inputs

```
"I've been feeling really down for the past few weeks. Nothing seems to bring me joy anymore, and I've been isolating myself from friends and family."
```

**Relationship Issues:**
```
"My partner and I have been fighting constantly lately. We can't seem to communicate without it turning into an argument."
```

### Study Stress Examples
