# ADK Wellness Bots

A comprehensive AI-powered wellness system built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) that provides specialized mental health support through two distinct agents: General Wellness and Study Stress Management.

## üåü Features

### General Wellness Agent
- **Emotional Analysis**: Identifies emotions, focus areas, and mental wellness patterns
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides tailored advice, wellness exercises, and resources
- **Safety-First Approach**: Built-in safety review and refinement system
- **Memory Integration**: Remembers previous conversations for continuity

### Study Stress Agent
- **Academic-Focused Analysis**: Specialized in student mental health and study-related challenges
- **Study Strategy Recommendations**: Time management, study techniques, and academic wellness
- **Task Prioritization**: Uses Eisenhower Priority Matrix for effective planning
- **Student-Specific Resources**: Targeted tools and techniques for academic success

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system uses a sophisticated multi-agent architecture with advanced feedback loops:

### Core Components

- **Parallel Processing**: Summary and recommendation agents work simultaneously for efficiency
- **Safety Refinement Loop**: Iterative safety review and improvement system
- **Memory Management**: Persistent conversation memory using Mem0
- **Modular Design**: Separate agents for different wellness domains

### Loop Agent System

#### Safety Refinement Loop
The system implements a sophisticated **LoopAgent** that ensures all responses meet safety standards:

1. **Safety Reviewer Agent**: 
   - Analyzes responses for harmful content
   - Checks for crisis indicators and red flags
   - Verifies professional tone and appropriateness
   - Ensures no medical diagnosis or prescription advice

2. **Safety Refiner Agent**:
   - Refines responses based on safety feedback
   - Removes harmful content and adds disclaimers
   - Improves professional tone
   - Adds crisis resource information when needed

3. **Iterative Improvement**:
   - Maximum 3 iterations to prevent infinite loops
   - Automatic escalation for serious concerns
   - Clean exit when safety criteria are met

#### Feedback Mechanisms

- **Real-time Safety Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 safety assessment
- **Concern Detection**: Identifies specific safety issues
- **Modification Tracking**: Logs required changes
- **Approval System**: Binary approval for summary and recommendations
- **Escalation Protocol**: Routes serious concerns to human review

## üöÄ Quick Start

from moodboard_wellness_agents.agent import root_agent

# Process a wellness conversation
response = root_agent.run("I've been feeling really anxious lately...")
```

#### Study Stress Agent
```python
from moodboard_study_agents.agent import root_agent

# Process academic stress conversation
response = root_agent.run("I have my final exams next week and I'm having panic attacks...")
```

## üìù Sample Inputs

### General Wellness Examples

**Anxiety & Stress:**
```
"I've been feeling really anxious lately. Work has been overwhelming with tight deadlines, and I can't seem to sleep properly. I keep worrying about everything and feel like I'm not good enough."
```

**Depression & Low Mood:**
```
"I've been feeling really down for the past few weeks. Nothing seems to bring me joy anymore, and I've been isolating myself from friends and family."
```

**Relationship Issues:**
```
"My partner and I have been fighting constantly lately. We can't seem to communicate without it turning into an argument."
```

### Study Stress Examples

**Exam Anxiety:**
```
"I have my final exams next week and I'm having panic attacks. I've been studying for 8 hours a day but I feel like I don't remember anything."
```

**Academic Perfectionism:**
```
"I'm a straight-A student but I'm completely overwhelmed. I spend 15 hours a day studying because I'm terrified of getting anything less than perfect grades."
```

**Procrastination:**
```
"I have three major assignments due this week but I keep procrastinating. I sit down to study but end up scrolling through social media for hours."
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `MODEL_NAME`: The LLM model to use (e.g., "gemini-1.5-pro")
